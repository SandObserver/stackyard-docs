   The width test is a media query, not a stored innerWidth, so it answers the
   same question the stylesheets ask. The user-agent test covers phones that
   report a wider CSS viewport than 768px, where a width query alone leaves a
   phone on the desktop layout; it is qualified by portrait so a phone held
   sideways gets the wider layout it has room for.

   else has run. */
